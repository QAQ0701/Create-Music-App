#  CreateMusic

## For music learners




##### What will this application do?
This application will allow the user to put notes on a treble clef staff with 4/4 time signature 
by choosing a time division and clicking on the line or space on the 5 lined staff corresponding to 
the noteOrRest they wish to produce. Simultaneously to the click placing down the noteOrRest, there will be audio feedback according
to the pitch generated. The application will contain the notes and rests in the following time division:

- Whole beat
- half beat
- quarter beat
- eight beat
- sixteenth beat

There will be a listening mode where the user can click on any noteOrRest they have placed down for the corresponding
pitch. There will also be a play mode where all the notes on the score will be play in order and with 
corresponding pitch and time value. The compositions could be saved and loaded.

##### Who will use it?
Beginner composers and musicians can use this application to compose pieces and play around with
notes and ideas while having simultaneous audio feedback. The time signature will be defaulted to 4/4 
because it is a common and a simple time signature that is beginner-friendly.

##### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because I play multiple instruments and there are often times 
where I just come up with random melodies that I end up really liking but it is gone with the wind 
whenever I try to remember or recreate what I just did. I think this application will be a solution 
to my problem because it records what the user is doing as they go.

### User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to choose time values and pitch for my notes.  
As a user, I want to be able to choose different time values for my rests.  
As a user, I want to be able to add and remove notes of my choice to the list of Notes.  
As a user, I want to retrieve individual notes from the list of notes.  
As a user, I want to be able to see the list of notes I have added so far.  
As a user, I want to be able to save my current Score.  
As a user, I want to be able to load my previously saved Score. 

### Phase 4: Task 2:
EventLog for this Session:  
Fri Nov 26 08:53:05 PST 2021  
1 Note Added to Score
1 Note Removed from Score  
Fri Nov 26 08:53:15 PST 2021  

### Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would want to try to add sound to the notes. I think I might refactor a superclass for the buttons
and make the Panel a Superclass for the StaffPane, PainterStaff, and PainterNoteRest.
